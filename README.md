# typeorm-loader
A database-aware data-loader for use with GraphQL and TypeORM.

## Description

This package exports `GraphQLDatabaseLoader`, which is a caching loader that folds a batch of different database queries into a singular database request.

## Installation

```
npm install typeorm-loader --save
```

## Usage

You should instantiate a new loader per session (just to be on the safe side, you don't want data leaking between user sessions), you instantiate it by passing the TypeORM connection as the first argument.

```ts
  import { GraphQLDatabaseLoader } from 'typeorm-loader';

  const connection = createConnection({ ... });
  const loader = new GraphQLDatabaseLoader(connection);
```

After which you would use it like so:

```ts
  Query: {
    getUserById: async (_: any, args: { id: string }, context: any, info: GraphQLResolveInfo) => {
      const result = await loader.loadOne(User, { id }, info);
      return result;
    }
  }
```

## API

```ts

/**
 * Load an entity from the database.
 * @param {typeof BaseEntity} entity The entity type to load.
 * @param where Query conditions.
 * @param {GraphQLResolveInfo} info (optional) GraphQL resolver information. If not provided, all fields are returned.
 * @returns {Promise<T>}
 */
async loadOne<T>(entity: Function, where: Partial<T>, info?: GraphQLResolveInfo): Promise<T | undefined>;

/**
 * Load multiple entities that meet the same criteria .
 * @param {Function} entity The entity type to load.
 * @param {Partial<T>} where The conditions to match.
 * @param {GraphQLResolveInfo} info (optional)  GraphQL resolver information. If not provided, all fields are returned.
 * @returns {Promise<T?[]>}
 */
async loadMany<T>(entity: Function, where: Partial<T>, info?: GraphQLResolveInfo): Promise<(T|undefined)[]>;

/**
 * Load multiple entities with different criteria.
 * @param {Function} entity The entity type to load.
 * @param {Partial<T>[]} where A series of conditions to match.
 * @param {GraphQLResolveInfo} info (optional)  GraphQL resolver information. If not provided, all fields are returned.
 * @returns {Promise<T?[]>}
 */
async batchLoadMany<T>(entity: Function, where: Partial<T>[], info?: GraphQLResolveInfo): Promise<(T|undefined)[]>;

/**
 * Clears the loader cache.
 */
clear(): void;

```
